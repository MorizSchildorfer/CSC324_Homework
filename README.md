# Ruby on Rails Tutorial

## DRYed

At the beginning of the semester, I had never worked with Ruby on Rails before. 
I went into this project with little to no web design experience but using the various tools available and the Hartl tutorial I managed to create a hopefully pleasant little site. I have dynamically created shown images, database entries, and the capability to add entries using forms. It is not seen on Heroku, but error display is also supported. 
These are all things I was unable to do at the beginning of the semester which I feel makes this website a great display of my progress.

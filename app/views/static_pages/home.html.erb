  <h1>Welcome to my Random Terrain Project</h1>
<h2> The current goal of this version was to see if I can display dynamically generated images on a Heroku published website. As you can see below, hopefully, I was successful!</h2>
<h2> Right now I am using a simple algorithm to map sine and cosine waves with varying frequencies into a grey space and that map that grey space into a color gradient going from red to blue. Additionally, I also apply a modifier to each position which will reduce or increase it based on its position in the image. As artistically pleasing it is right now, I hope to add more organic structure to it in the future.</h2>

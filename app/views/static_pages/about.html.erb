<h1>What all this is about</h1>
<div> 
<h2> I am currently taking <a href="https://csc324-326.sites.grinnell.edu/">this</a> course and for it I have to use Rails to build a website and deploy it to Heroku through GitHub. 
Since we needed elements of randomness and I had a personal project I had been neglecting in favor of school that used a lot of randomness it felt like a great fit. Luckily this manages to fix some of the issues I had origanlly! (like showing the images to other people in a simple fashion)</h2>
I am hoping to at some point reach a level of care and detail as the following image, but alas today is not yet the day.

<p> The current algorithm work using a combination of sine and cosine waves with offset frequencies to create an initial wavy structure.
Then I create an offset from the original calculated value based on distance from the center (this does not add much to the structure and initially was meant as an experiment, but in combination with the next step created beautiful images.)
The next and final step is to apply a color gradiant to every pixel which takes the current value and uses it to calculate RGB values by scaling into the 0-255 range with maximum and minimum values of the current image, that range the is split into 4 edges of the RGB cube to create transissions.
Other versions of this algorithm made use of jumps in the transitions to create interesting shapes and will be considered again in the future.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the semester, I had never worked with Ruby on Rails before. 
I went into this project with little to no web design experience but using the various tools available and the Hartl tutorial I managed to create a hopefully pleasant little site. I have dynamically created shown images, database entries, and the capability to add entries using forms. It is not seen on Heroku, but error display is also supported. 
These are all things I was unable to do at the beginning of the semester which I feel makes this website a great display of my progress.
